This project was modeled after [ToDoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). We were supplied with an Angular.js front end and we created a backend in a Django framework to make the ToDo program fully functional. We utilized the Django Rest Framework to accomplish this.

To run the program you will need to install the requirements via the line 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Afterwards you will be able to run the program with the command line prompt 'python manage.py runserver'
